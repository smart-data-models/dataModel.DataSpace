  Vocabulary services provide an overview of available data models in the data space. 
  This allows participants of the data space to choose common data models for a particular 
  application. In the rulebook, some data models can be made mandatory to ensure semantic 
  interoperability between participants.

  Vocabulary Services can also link these data models to APIs/technical interfaces for data 
  exchange, providing semantics and syntax.
