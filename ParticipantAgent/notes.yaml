  Participant agent services allow a participant, as the name suggests, to participate in a 
  data space. These services provide the basic functionality required by every participant 
  in the data space. Such services play a vital role in ensuring trust in a data space as 
  they differentiate between a data plane and a control plane. The control plane is key here 
  as it implements functionalities for identification, publishing of data sets, etc. 

  Within the Participant Agent, several parts can be identified.

  -  The control plane handles user identification, access, and usage policies, while the data 
     plane handles the actual exchange of data.This implies that the control plane can be 
     standardised to a high level, using common standards for identification, authentication, etc.

  -  The data plane can be different for each data space and use case depending on the types of
     data exchange that take place. Some data spaces focus on sharing large datasets, others on 
     message exchange, and others take an event-based approach. There is no one-size-fits-all, 
     although some mechanisms (especially in the data interoperability pillar) can assist in 
     making sure different data planes work together.

  -  The credential store is used to store credentials (identities and attestations) which have 
     been issued by the validation and verification federation service. This could include 
     credentials indicating that a participant is a member of a particular data space, for example.

  The credential store is also used to present credentials to other participants in the data space
  and to validate credentials from others.
