#### InteroperableAssets NGSI-LD normalized Example    
Here is an example of a InteroperableAssets in JSON-LD format as normalized. This is compatible with NGSI-LD when not using options and returns the context data of an individual entity.

The initiative focuses on using JSON Schema as a core component, enabling exports in various formats to enhance compatibility with semantic and linked data approaches. By providing these open-licensed, standardized data models, the initiative seeks to combat data silos, improve data sharing, and facilitate application portability across different platforms and sectors, ultimately fostering innovation and interoperability in smart solutions.",
