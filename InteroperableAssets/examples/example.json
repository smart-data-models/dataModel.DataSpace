      "description": "A Linked Data Event Stream (LDES) is a technical standard that applies linked data principles to data streams, allowing for the exchange of data between silos in a sustainable and cost-effective manner. It is defined as a collection of immutable objects, called LDES members, described using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). LDES enables data publishers to publish their datasets as append-only collections, allowing consumers to replicate the full dataset and keep it synchronized, while also facilitating real-time updates and improving data usability and findability",

It represents context information as entities with properties and relationships, using a property graph model with semantics based on RDF and the semantic web framework. NGSI-LD builds upon previous context management frameworks and can be serialized using JSON-LD, making it compatible with linked data principles and allowing for unique IRI identifiers for entities and relationships",

It aims to support a digital marketplace of smart solutions by developing common, royalty-free data models that are publicly available. The initiative focuses on using JSON Schema as a core component, enabling exports in various formats to enhance compatibility with semantic and linked data approaches. By providing these open-licensed, standardized data models, the initiative seeks to combat data silos, improve data sharing, and facilitate application portability across different platforms and sectors, ultimately fostering innovation and interoperability in smart solutions.",
