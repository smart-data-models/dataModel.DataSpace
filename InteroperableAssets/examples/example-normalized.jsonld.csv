It is defined as a collection of immutable objects, called LDES members, described using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). LDES enables data publishers to publish their datasets as append-only collections, allowing consumers to replicate the full dataset and keep it synchronized, while also facilitating real-time updates and improving data usability and findability", "LDES", "1.0", "https://semiceu.github.io/LinkedDataEventStreams/", "NGSI LD", "NGSI-LD is an information model and API for publishing, querying, and subscribing to context information, standardized by ETSI to facilitate open exchange and sharing of structured data across various domains. It represents context information as entities with properties and relationships, using a property graph model with semantics based on RDF and the semantic web framework.

The initiative focuses on using JSON Schema as a core component, enabling exports in various formats to enhance compatibility with semantic and linked data approaches. By providing these open-licensed, standardized data models, the initiative seeks to combat data silos, improve data sharing, and facilitate application portability across different platforms and sectors, ultimately fostering innovation and interoperability in smart solutions.", "Smart-Data-Models", "WeatherObserved", "0.3", "https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Weather/blob/master/WeatherObserved/doc/spec.md", "https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.DataSpace/context.jsonld"
